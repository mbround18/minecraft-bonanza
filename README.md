# Minecraft Bonanza

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.0.


This is a pet project while I am learning Angular 5. In this project it offers a countdown to Minecraft Bonanza, a home page with information, and a map page which has an iframe to the minecraft dynmap.
If you so desire you can modify this project locally to host your own minecraft bonanza but it is required that you have a bukkit or spigot server with dynmap installed and for the url the map be correct in the app.component.ts file.
If you so choose to use this repository use it at your own risk as I am still learning Angular and could provide very limited support.
